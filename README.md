# mongodbdemo

Make sure to:
```npm install```

For the demo, I created a free mongo cluster at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.

Grab the url from that site and plug into https://github.com/kylepace/mongodbdemo/blob/master/Node/server.js#L19

The following command then starts the server on port 3000:
```node server```
